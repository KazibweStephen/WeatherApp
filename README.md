# WeatherApp

A simple weather app that can take a location input, then display some details about the weather. 

Has the following user stories:
STORY-1: As a user, I can enter my location into the app. There should be an input field allowing a user to enter a location (a City/state/country/zipcode/etc) into the app.

STORY-2: As a user, I have a button to retrieve weather info for an entered location. There should be a button labeled "Go!", "Show", or similar which uses the input location from STORY-1 to retrieve weather for the given location.Â 

STORY-3: As a user, I can see the weather conditions for a location for the next 14 days. Using the data retrieved by the action in STORY-2, there needs to be a display of that location's current weather conditions. The attributes that should be included are at least:
* Temperature (in F)
* Pressure
* Humidity
* Current condition (sun, clouds, rain, fog,etc)
* Chance of precipitation

STORY-4: As a user, I can refresh to see the weather for the entered location I should be able to pull and refresh the list.

Notes:
- The app using *rapidapi* for Open Weather Map API.
- Most of the app layout is done programatically, just one view was using Nib files.
- There are unit testing and UI testing.
